I started my position as a lecturer at the university of Manchester at the end of 2024, following on from a post-doc at King’s College London (St Thomas’ Hospital) developing novel non-contrast methods for quantitative cardiac MRI. Before this, I completed a PhD at the University of Oxford developing methods for magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (13C and 31P) to interrogate the metabolism of the failing heart.

My research is now focused on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, including both data acquisition and analysis. I am particularly interested in imaging the heart in the immediate period after a heart attack with T2, T2* and QSM imaging. Iron deposition in the most serious heart attacks has been identified as a key risk factor for major cardiac events and heart failure but is difficult to image. Enhancements to iron identification with T2* or QSM imaging would enable enhanced risk stratification and improvements to patient care.

I am seconded to the UK Biobank imaging program for part of my time, to provide physics expertise, and deliver improvements to MRI data quality assurance, with a focus on cardiac and abdominal imaging. I am also involved in research projects using the UK Biobank MRI dataset to predict disease.
