I come from Uganda, and hold a bachelor’s degree in biological sciences and a master’s in radiation biology. These courses gave me a decent understanding of cancer biology and radiation oncology, and currently, my areas of interest lie in neuroocology, radiation therapy, and neuroimaging.

I am investigating the effects of brain irradiation in the normal brain tissue, and how these effects contribute to cognitive decline in mice. Despite playing a critical role in curative and palliative treatment of brain tumours, radiotherapy (RT) damages the peritumoral normal brain tissue, which contributes to cognitive decline in up to 90 % of those who survive past 6 months after treatment. However, the exact mechanism (s) of how cognitive decline occurs after brain tumour treatment is not well understood. In my PhD project, I aim to examine how RT affects cerebral blood flow, blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity, and neuroinflammation, and how changes in these physiological processes relate to cognitive changes.
