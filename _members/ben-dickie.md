Ben Dickie is a Senior Lecturer in Neuroimaging at the University of Manchester. He completed his undergraduate degree in Physics at the University of Manchester and a master’s degree in Medical Physics at the University of Leeds, before undertaking a PhD focused on developing MRI biomarkers for cancer prognostication.
Following his PhD, he completed postdoctoral research with Professor Geoff Parker and Professor Laura Parkes, where he advanced MRI methodologies for quantifying blood–brain barrier water exchange.
He now leads a preclinical MRI research group dedicated to developing highly sensitive magnetic resonance imaging techniques to probe perfusion, diffusion, and fluid exchange within the brain. His multidisciplinary team—comprising biologists, physicists, and engineers—integrates complementary imaging modalities, such as multiphoton microscopy and functional ultrasound (fUS), with in-silico modelling to rigorously evaluate and validate emerging neuroimaging approaches.
