I am a proud lifelong Disabled Mancunian. I graduated with a BSc(Hons) in Physics from what used be called UMIST (now UoM’s North Campus) in 1998, gained an MSc in Medical Physics from the Victoria University of Manchester (now UoM’s South Camps) in 2000 and achieved a PhD in Medical Imaging Physics from The University of Manchester in 2005. I have been lucky enough to be employed as a Research Associate on successive medical imaging research projects since 2004, mostly on MRI and mainly in the brain. I was promoted to Research Fellow in 2023 and was appointed to a new role as Senior Technical Specialist in MR Imaging Physics which started in November 2025. I provide critical imaging analyses expertise, in-house skills training to students and clinical and radiography colleagues, and contribute to funding applications. Diffusion MRI is my favourite imaging method! I co-supervise 2 PhD students. I am passionate about equality, equity, diversity, inclusion and accessibility and am well-known for my activism and advocacy on Disability Inclusion both within and beyond the University.

I currently work with Prof Laura Parkes and others on various neuroimaging projects focussing on conditions such as Dementia (SIDD, All-In-One), Stroke (Stroke-IMPaCT, StrokeCogBBB) and Concussion (mTBI). I also collaborate with Dr Sarah Al-Bachari at UCL as co-PI on the ENIGMA-PD-Vasc white matter lesion segmentation project.
