Hola, hola! I am Sebastián, born and raised in Colombia. I did my undergraduate program in biomedical engineering at Universidad de los Andes in Bogotá, the capital city of Colombia. During that time, I had the opportunity of studying abroad in Australia and Japan by earning a place in exchange programs. These experiences allowed me to meet lots of people from all over the world and sparked my interest in doing my postgraduates studies overseas.  Consequently, I did my master’s degree in bioengineering at the University of Tokyo in Japan, where I first got introduced to the glymphatic system. This aroused my interest in pursuing further research within this field, which brought me to UoM for my PhD program.

My research project is focused on developing novel modelling and MRI approaches to investigate the biophysical mechanisms that regulate water transport in the brain, linked to the role of the glymphatic system in Alzheimer’s disease.
