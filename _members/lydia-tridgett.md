I graduated with an MSci in Neuroscience from the University of Manchester in 2024. I completed my master’s degree investigating the use of dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI on blood-brain and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier leakage after mild traumatic brain injury. I am currently pursuing a PhD in Neuroscience, building upon this work with a growing interest in CSF fluid dynamics.

My research aims to investigate the effects of mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) on blood-brain and blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier integrity and changes in fluid dynamics post injury. Using advanced MRI, such as dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI and diffusion tensor imaging, we can assess changes to barrier permeability and CSF flow to understand the underlying pathophysiology of mild TBI. The aim is to conduct this clinically and preclinically to establish translational insights into injury biomarkers.
