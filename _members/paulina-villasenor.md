I completed my master’s degree at the Institute of Neurobiology (INB-UNAM) in Mexico, where I focused on disentangling cortical microstructural abnormalities using a multi-tensor diffusion MRI approach. Since, I've been very engaged looking at the brain function and structure with MRI.

Currently, as a PhD student, my research explores the mechanisms of water efflux in the context of a disrupted blood-brain barrier. I study how inflammatory responses influence the interactions between the vasculature, aquaporin-4 channels, and glial cells. My work integrates in-vivo preclinical MRI, water exchange modeling, and ex-vivo histological validation.

Outside the lab, you’ll usually find me hiking with my dog Poncho, trying new food or taking care of my plants.
