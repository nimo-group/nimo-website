I am an MRI physicist with interests in MR methods development, particularly applied to endogenous and exogenous contrast agents as quantitative neuroimaging biomarkers of brain structure, function, and metabolism. My work aims to improve understanding of brain health and disease, with a particular interest in tumour oxygenation, metabolism, and haemodynamics. With the UK Biobank I am responsible for ensuring neuroimaging data quality of the ongoing acquisition of MRI in 160k+ participants for the world’s largest and deepest biomedical research database.
