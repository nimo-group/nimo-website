Dr Yolanda Ohene is a Wellcome Accelerator Award Research Fellow, her work focusses on developing and translating advanced MRI techniques (particularly ASL and diffusion MRI) for the early detection of neurodegenerative disease. Her research interests are also around improving inclusion for neuroimaging and dementia research, particular for the Black community.

Yolanda holds an MSci in Physics from Imperial College London (2013), a Masters in Plasma Physics from UPMC and École Polytechnique, France (2014), and a PhD in Medical Imaging from University College London (2020). Yolanda was awarded the Institute of Physics’ Jocelyn Bell Burnell Bronze Medal and Prize in 2019 for outstanding contribution to physics by an early career researcher for her work in the development of a new MRI technique and The Women in Neuroscience UK’s Equality, Diversity and Inclusion Award (2025).

Alongside scientific research, Yolanda is a keen science communicator and has spoken at The Royal Institution, Cambridge Theatre London, and at large science events including New Scientist Live, Cheltenham Science Festival, and The British Science Festival, where she was the recipient of one of the Award Lectures (2021). Yolanda has been featured on the BBC and in The Guardian advocating for better equity in STEM fields and is one of the directors for The Blackett Lab Family C.I.C, UK Collective for physicists of Black heritage, to represent, connect, and inspire the next generation of physicists.
