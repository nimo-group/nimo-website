This project aims to assess whether ferumoxytol-induced signal change can act as a biomarker of tumour growth and macrophage infiltration (inflammation). Additional computational modelling and phantom work is used to assess dynamic gadolinium and ferumoxytol interactions and their effects on quantitative metrics (R1/R2/R2*).
