This project will develop and deploy novel MRI acquisition and data analysis techniques to assist the identification of factors that confer cognitive resilience during ageing. Specifically, we are building computational models of brain plasticity, using data from large-scale epidemiological projects (e.g. the UK Biobank and Human Connectome Project) and structural, functional, and neurochemical data from experimental MRI research.
