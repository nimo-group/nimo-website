This project aims to develop our understanding of the principles that govern the action and potential interactions of elevated oxygen concentration. Acquisition and analysis techniques are being developed to investigate signal intensity/time-concentration effects, and how these are affected by physiology/physiological response (e.g. autoregulatory vasoconstriction, varying permeability of the blood-brain barrier).
